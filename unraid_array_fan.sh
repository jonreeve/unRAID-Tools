# unraid_array_fan.sh v0.6
# v0.1: By xamindar: First try at it.
# v0.2: Made a small change so the fan speed on low doesn't fluctuate every time the script is run.
# v0.3: It will now enable fan speed change before trying to change it. I missed
#        it at first because pwmconfig was doing it for me while I was testing the fan.
# v0.4: Corrected temp reading to "Temperature_Celsius" as my new Seagate drive
#        was returning two numbers with just "Temperature".
# v0.5: By Pauven:  Added linear PWM logic to slowly ramp speed when fan is between HIGH and OFF.
# v0.6: By kmwoley: Added fan start speed. Added logging, suppressed unless fan speed is changed.
# v0.7: jonreeve: added fan name so I can dupe the script for front and rear fans, added RPM logging
# A simple script to check for the highest hard disk temperatures in an array
# or backplane and then set the fan to an apropriate speed. Fan needs to be connected
# to motherboard with pwm support, not array.
# DEPENDS ON:grep,awk,smartctl,hdparm
